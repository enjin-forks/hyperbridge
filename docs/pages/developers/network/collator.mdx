# Becoming a Collator

Our system is designed to reward active and reliable participants by allowing them to use their earnings as a reputation score, which is the primary factor in Collator
selection. By becoming a Collator, a Relayer plays a more direct role in the network's security and block production, unlocking possibilities for rewards and participation.

## Who is a Collator
Collators are Block producers for the Hyperbridge Blockchain. Collators are essential for keeping the Hyperbridge chain live and processing transactions.
They are rewarded with `$BRIDGE` tokens for their work. The primary responsibility for Collators on Hyperbridge are:

- **Collecting Transactions**: They gather transactions from users.
- **Producing Blocks**: They ensure the production of Blocks.
- **Submitting to Polkadot Validators**: They submit Blocks  along with proof to the relay chain validators, in this case, Polkadot.

## Core Concepts: How Reputation Works

Before diving deep into the steps required, it is important to understand the two tokens involved:

- **The Hyperbridge Token(`$BRIDGE`)**: This is the primary token a Relayer earns as a reward for relaying messages. It is the real transferable asset that reflects or represents your earnings.
- **The Reputation Asset**: This is a special, non-transferable asset that acts as a Relayer's reputation score. It is designed to mirrror a Relayer's Hyperbridge token earnings.
The ratio of this asset to a Relayer's `$BRIDGE` earnings is 1 to 1. For every `$BRIDGE` token earned by a Relayer, an equal amount of the Reputation Asset is automatically minted to the Relayer's account.

**Key Insight**: Your reputation score is directly tied to your success as a Relayer. The more messages you relay, the more `$BRIDGE` you earn,
the higher your reputation score becomes, and the better your chances of being selected as a Collator

## The path to becoming a Collator
The process involves three main stages: Accruing reputation score/asset, preparing your node, and registering one's candidacy.

### Step 1: Accrue Reputation by Relaying Messages
This is the foundation of the entire system. The primary goal is to be an active and reliable relayer.

**Why Relayers**: Hyperbridge's Collator selection mechanism is based on proven economic activity on Hyperbridge. By rewarding relayers with reputation, we ensure that our collators are experienced,
active, amd invested participants in the network success. This meritocratic approach secures the network by selecting for proven value creation.

**Action**: Continue to relay messages or/and consensus proofs between connected chains

**Outcome**: For every reward you receive in `$BRIDGE`, the `pallet-messaging-relayer-fees` and `pallet-consensus-incentives` will automatically mint an equivalent amount of the Reputation Asset
to your account. You can always find your Reputation Asset balance under the Polkadot JS UI by going to `Developer > Chain State > Assets > Account`.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Collator Node and Session Keys
To be a collator, you must run a full node and have set of hot keys known as session keys, available in your node's keystore. These keys are used for signing blocks.

**Action 1: Set up a Collator Node**: You must have a fully synced node running the hyperbridge binary with --collator flag.
Ensure it is stable and has a relaible network connection.

**Action 2: Generate session Keys**: On your running collator node, you will need to generate your session keys by making an `author_rotateKeys` RPC Call.
You can do this with a curl command:


```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9990
```

Note: Replace 9990 with your node's RPC port if it is different.
This command will return a long hex string. This is your session key public key

**Action 3: Link your keys**: You must now tell the blockchain that your main  account (`AccountId`) will use these new session keys for collating.
You do this by calling the `session.setKeys` extrinsic.

- Navigate to `Developer -> Extrinsics` in the Polkadot UI.
- Select your main account(the one with the reputation score).
- Choose the `session` pallet and the `setKeys` extrinsic.
- Paste the entire hex string from the previous step into the `keys` field.
- Leave the `proof` field empty (0x00).
- Sign and submit the transaction.

### Step 3: Register as a Candidate
Now that the node is ready and your keys are linked, you can now declare your intention to becoming a Collator.

**Action**: Call the `collatorSelection.registerAsCandidate` extrinsic.

- Navigate to `Developer -> Extrinsics` in the Polkadot-JS UI.
- Select your main account.
- Choose the `collatorSelection` pallet and the `registerAsCandidate` extrinsic.
- Sign and submit the transaction.

This transaction will enable you to enter the candidacy pool.

## The selection process & what happens next

At the beginning of each new session, our `pallet-collator-manager` runs it's selection logic:

- It fetches the list of all registered candidates who have set their sesssion keys.
- It ranks them from highest to lowest based on their Reputation Asset balance.
- It selects the top candidates to fill the available collator slots for the new session.

If you are selected:

- Your Reputation Asset balance will be burned. This is somewhat like your stake for the session.
- Your node will begin authoring and producing blocks after 2 rounds(sessions). To do this, it must be running with the `--validator` flag
in addition to the `--collator` flag
- Bear in mind that as you are still performing your duties of relaying messages or consensus proofs, you will keep stacking `$BRIDGE` rewards
and your reputation asset will start increasing too, allowing you to compete for a spot in future sessions.

If you are not selected:

- You remain in the candidate pool.
- Continue relaying messages to increase you Reputation Asset balance and improve your chances of being selected in the next session.

This creates a dynamic and meritocratic system where the most active and successful participants are rewarded with the responsibility of securing the network.
