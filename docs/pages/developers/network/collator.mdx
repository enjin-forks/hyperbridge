# Becoming a Collator

Our system is designed to reward active and reliable participants by allowing them to use their earnings as a reputation score, which is the primary factor in Collator
selection. By becoming a Collator, a Relayer plays a more direct role in the network's security and block production, unlocking possibilities for rewards and participation.

## Who is a Collator
Collators are Block producer for the Hyperbridge Blockchain. Collators are essential for keeping the Hyperbridge chain live and processing transactions.
They are rewarded with $BRIDGE tokens for their work. The primary responsibility for Collators on Hyperbridge are:

1. Collecting Transactions: They gather transactions from users.
2. Producing Blocks: They ensure the production of Blocks.
3. Submitting to Polkadot Validators: They submit Blocks  along with proof to the relay chain validators, in this case, Polkadot.

## Core Concepts: How Reputation Works

Before diving deep into the steps required, it is important to understand the two tokens involved:

1. The Hyperbridge Token($BRIDGE): This is the primary token a Relayer earns as a reward for relaying messages. It is the real transferable asset that reflects or represents your earnings.
2. The Reputation Asset: This is a special, non-transferable asset that acts as a Relayer's reputation score. It is designed to mirrror a Relayer's Hyperbridge token earnings.
The ratio of this asset to a Relayer's $BRIDGE earnings is 1 to 1. For every $BRIDGE token earned by a Relayer, an equal amount of the Reputation Asset is automatically minted to the Relayer's account.

Key Insight: Your reputation score is directly tied to your success as a Relayer. The more messages you relay, the more $BRIDGE you earn,
the higher your reputation score becomes, and the better your chances of being selected as a Collator
